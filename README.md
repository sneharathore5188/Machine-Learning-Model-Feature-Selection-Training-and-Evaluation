# Machine Learning Model: Feature Selection, Training, and Evaluation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model, covering feature selection, model training, and evaluation. It includes essential steps such as data preprocessing, model selection, training, and performance visualization.

## Steps Involved

### Step 1: Import Required Libraries
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `sklearn` for machine learning modeling and evaluation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

### Step 2: Load and Preprocess Data
- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Encode categorical variables if necessary
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets

### Step 3: Feature Selection
- Identify important features using statistical techniques
- Select the best subset of features for model training

### Step 4: Model Training
- Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- Train the model using the training dataset

### Step 5: Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Generate a classification report

### Step 6: Confusion Matrix Visualization
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred), annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
plt.xlabel("Predicted")
plt.ylabel("Actual")
plt.title("Confusion Matrix")
plt.show()
```

### Step 7: Model Completion Notification
```
print("\nMachine Learning Model Training Complete!")
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies using `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`.
3. Run the script to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of training and evaluating a machine learning model, emphasizing feature selection, model training, and performance analysis.
